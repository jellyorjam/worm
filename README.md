**WORM**

Worm is a web app that allows users to interact with the books they've read. Users can track books, find new books, and see data visualizations into what kind of reader they are.

Worm is built with React/Redux on the front-end and Node/Express/Mongo on the back-end. For this project I learned Material UI and RTK Query.
Worm uses data from Google Books API and OpenLibrary API.

This is my final individual capstone project for Parsity Coding School.
